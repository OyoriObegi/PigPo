                <li>Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan and fry 4 pork chops with the garlic over a medium heat for 5 minutes each side. Discard the garlic and set the chops aside, covered with foil to keep warm.</li>

            <p>Cut the pork into strips. Fry with the garlic and 150g chestnut mushrooms, thickly sliced. Follow the recipe, but swap the mustard for 1 tbsp smoked paprika for a speedy stroganoff.</p>
