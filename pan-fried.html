                    <li>Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Heat the oil in a small ovenproof frying pan and season the chop on both sides. Hold the chop in the pan with tongs, skin-side down, for about 5 minutes to help crisp up the skin and render some fat.</li>
                    <li>Once the fat is browned, fry the chop for 3 minutes on each side until just golden. Add 4 sage leaves to the pan, then transfer the pan to the oven and cook for 5-6 minutes until the sage leaves are crisp and the chop is just cooked through (just over 60°C in the centre on a digital thermometer or when the juices run clear when pierced with a skewer). Set aside for the chop to rest in the pan for 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, chop the remaining 2 sage leaves. Put them in a small pan with a lid, along with the chopped apple and potato. Add the milk and just enough water to cover, then put the lid on and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 10 minutes until the apple and potato are soft. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid, then return the apple, potato and sage to the pan and mash until smooth. Mix in the crème fraîche and just enough reserved cooking liquid to give a smooth consistency. Taste and season with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Serve the chop, mash, crispy sage leaves and steamed kale with wholegrain mustard and the chop’s cooking juices spooned over the top.</li>
