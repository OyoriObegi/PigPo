                    <li>Heat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/gas 6. Mix the honey, wholegrain mustard, crushed garlic and olive oil in a bowl. Put the pork chops in a roasting tin and coat in half the honey mixture. Roast for 20 minutes, basting halfway through with the juices.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, peel and cut the potatoes into even chunks, then cook in a large pot of salted water for 15-20 minutes until tender. Drain and mash with butter, a splash of milk and plenty of salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>While the potatoes are cooking, put the remaining marinade into a small saucepan over a medium-high heat with fresh chicken stock and white wine vinegar. Bubble for 5-10 minutes until reduced by a third. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve the chops with the mash and gravy.</li>
